#### Description:
Multipurpose & Gaming (MPG) is a website that was built with HTML, CSS, and Python. 

Here are some of the website's features:
- QR Code Generator (MP)
- Password Generator (MP)
- Random # Generator (MP)
- Guess the Number (G)

application.py contains the backend portion of the website made with Python.
qr.py contains the 'generateqr' function for the QR Code Generator feature.

/static includes pictures and icons.
/templates includes .html files.

All in all, I wanted to create a minimalistic-style website where it has a variety of different features. I really like the idea of color gradients hence the background. Since this is my first ever public project, there may be bugs and areas where I could improve the code. All in all, this website has served as a massive learning experience with HTML, CSS, and Python!
